                <h3 style={{color: "#50fa7b"}}>FoodSaver</h3>
                <p>My first Hackathon project ever! I made this in 2018 at <span style={{color: "#ffb86c"}}><b>SMHacks II</b></span>, in which we got runner up (that was a nice start to my hackathon career üòÅ). The premise of the project was to mitigate food waste by finding recipes taht people could make using the leftover food in their fridge. Furthermore, the application accounted for what recipes you used, and would suggest recipes to use whatever food you had leftover. By the end of the hackathon, the focus of the application had shifted to suggesting recipes to people based on what they had in their fridge.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We used a really odd stack, since this was our first time developing a full solution.</li>
                    <li>We used HTML/CSS for the front end, without any libraries or CSS templates</li>
                    <li>The backend was written in Java with a SpringBoot framework</li>
                    <li>To go above and beyond, we wrote a rudimentary login API using Python and SQLite</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style={{color: "#8be9fd"}}>SpeakAR</h3>
                <p>My submission to <span style={{color: "#ff5555"}}><b>DVHacks</b></span> in January 2019! SpeakAR was a project that projected the translated name of an object in AR above the object. In simple terms, if you put the camera in front of, for example, a key, it would put the translation of key into a different language in 3d block letters above the object. The language for translation could be configured using the settings menu. Unfortunately, due to the unstable nature of Flutter at the time, our project became corrupted :/</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As stated before, this was written in the Flutter framework using Dart. We were one of the early adopters, using flutter a mere 2 weeks after release</li>
                    <li>The ML was handled in two ways - initially we tried to compile a tensoflow lite model, but due to incompatibilities with our system, we were unable to do so (and this is when I ditched Windows).</li>
                    <li>We instead handled the AI using Firebase's object detection model</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style={{color: "#ff79c6"}}>The Drone Project</h3>
                <p>Our submission for CodeDay BA, Spring 2019! This project involved the devision of a raspberry-pi-powered drone, using stepper motors and a wooden frame. This drone was heavily engineered to be IoT-focused, with features like a web dashboard to monitor its diagnostics (altitude, speed, yaw, pitch, etc.), a live video feed that could be patched into a VR Headset (on multiple devices), and more! This project won us the best hardware hack at CBDA!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We used DNSmasq to use the Raspberry Pi as a router - essentially allowing the raspi to act as a WiFi hotspot</li>
                    <li>There were two webservers involved:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The JS server we used to serve our dashboard, coded in React.js</li>
                            <li>The Flask server used to serve video feed in both a website (which we didn't have time to style) and a video feed, experienced in VR</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The flight controller's code was written in C++, with some early object detection code written in python.</li>
                </ul>

            <Item>
                <h3 style={{color: "#bd93f9"}}>The Glove</h3>
                <p>Our submission to HackMerced in 2019 (I don't remember what month) where we submitted this to the AGTech Track. Our project revolved around the usage of two IMUs put on a 'glove', which we parsed the input from into Unity. In Unity, we cleaned this data with a Kalman filter, leaving the data ready to be used to for various purposes, like manipulating a 3-axis arm.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We felt that this project had not reached its full potential yet, so we submitted an interface between the glove and a robotic arm to Millibit Hacks in 2019. While we didn't win an award (since we didn't make a VR project, necessarily), we were invited to demonstrate our project to the UC Berkeley VR department</li>
                    <li>This project was largely written in Unity, so we used C# as a standard so that we could maintain a common denominator in our code. However, for prototyping we wrote some data parsers using C++</li>
                    <li>This project is what I consider to be the most industry-ready project I've ever built - the applications in aeronautics, oil, and various industries are limitless</li>
                </ul>
