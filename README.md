# Personal Website

My personal website/blog, written using the Next.js meta-framework (wrapper for React).

The website itself isn't super modular - the index page especially is somewhat 
hardcoded. However the rest of the website (especially the blog section)
is extremely modular.

This website is licensed under the MIT License - so go do whatever the heck you
want with this code. Just make sure to credit me :)
