If you didn't know already, I'm a senior applying to college at the moment. It's exciting! It's reassuring to know that my un-memorable essays, lackluster GPA, and unorthodox extracurriculars will be placed in the hands of an admissions officer more irritated at my personality than I. Truly a reassuring, not very stressful time!

That's not to say college admissions don't have their benefits. Asides from, you know, actually getting me admission into an institution. They've also allowed me to self-reflect on myself, and actually think about how I interact with the environment around me.
